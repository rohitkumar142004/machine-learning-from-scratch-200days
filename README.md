# 200 Days of Machine Learning

This repository contains my personal handwritten notes as I learn Machine Learning from YouTube lectures and online resources.  
I will upload one topic every day for 200 days, including fundamentals, algorithms, math, and Python implementations.

Goals:
- Build strong ML fundamentals
- Maintain consistent daily learning habit
- Create a complete set of ML handwritten notes
- Track my progress openly

Content includes:
- ML basics
- Statistics & Probability
- Linear Regression, Logistic Regression
- Classification & Clustering
- Decision Trees, SVM, Naive Bayes
- Feature Engineering
- Model Evaluation
- Deep Learning Basics
